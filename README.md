In this project, i tried to simulate  speed control of a dc motor, and document all the theories and the simulation part,
 i have tested all the responses and list the problems with  all the necessary plots,
 i used pid contoller to maintain the speed of the dc motor 
 all the block diagram and the design of the pid controller are present in the files 

this is the working model, with just small change in the transfer function you can change the speed control to angle control
